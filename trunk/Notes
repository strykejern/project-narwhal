TODO:
- Interceptor that shoots lasers
- Uber antimatter rockets
- Tetiary weapon for campaign


SECONDARY TODO:
- AI do not use Warp
- Ambusher AI
- Black holes
- Wormholes
- AI edge improvement

Weapon Ideas
*EMP Rockets 			- Good vs. Shields and drains Energy, low Life damage
*Nuclear Rocket 		- Ongoing radiation damage if shields are penentrated
Antimatter Torpedoes	- No homing, extreme high damage, big explosion (destroy planets?)
*Laser 					- Low damage, fast fire 
*Phasor					- Balls of energy, high damage, slow fire
*Lightning				- Rays of lightning, bad vs shield, high damage, low range, high cost
*Interceptor			- Fires mini AI controlled ship that fires minishots (costs Life)
*Minigun				- Regular boring bullets?

Ship Modules (Passive?)
Shield Booster			- Faster Shield Regeneration
Dynamo Reactor			- Can use shield as energy
*ECM Jammer				- 70% chance to evade rockets (disable homing?) Maybe disables enemy radar? disable cloaking
*Augumented Engines		- Faster movement
*Automatic Repair System- Regenerate Life
*Interphased Drive		- Faster Acceleration
*Warp Engine 			- Sudden boost in speed, costs energy
*Gravity Stabiliser		- Immune to Gravity and no damage from hitting planets
*Side Thrusters			- Allows strafing
*Internal Nullifier		- Extreme fast turning rate

Mouse button 1 - Fire main weapon
Mouse button 2 - fire secondary
Both		   - Use special (if any, such as jammer or interphased drive)

RADAR
level 0 - nothing
level 1 - Show direction of all spaceships
level 2 - show distance and incoming missiles, opponent shield, red arrows for enemies
level 3 - show opponent energy and life, extra aim helper
