Antimatter Torpedoes	- No homing, extreme high damage, big explosion (destroy planets?)
Phasor					- Balls of energy, high damage, slow fire
Lightning				- Rays of lightning, bad vs shield, high damage, low range, high cost
Interceptor				- Fires mini AI controlled ship that fires minishots (costs Life)
Minigun					- Regular boring bullets?

Ship Modules (Passive?)
ECM Jammer				- 70% chance to evade rockets (disable homing?) Maybe disables enemy radar?
Shield Booster			- Faster Shield Regeneration
Dynamo Reactor			- Can use shield as energy
Automatic Repair System	- Regenerate Life
Augumented Engines		- Faster movement
Interphased Drive		- Faster Acceleration
Warp Engine 			- Sudden boost in speed, costs energy
Gravity Stabiliser		- Immune to Gravity and no damage from hitting planets
*Side Thrusters			- Allows strafing
*Internal Nullifier		- Extreme fast turning rate
