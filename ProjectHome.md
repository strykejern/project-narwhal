# SHIP WEAPONS #

Here is a short summary of SOME of the weapons a ship can have. I'm to lazy to list them
all here. There are many.

WEAPON					EFFECT
  * EMP Rockets 			- Good vs. Shields and drains Energy, low Life damage
  * Nuclear Rocket 		    - Ongoing radiation damage if shields are penentrated
  * Laser 					- Low damage, fast fire
  * Phasor					- Balls of energy, high damage, slow fire
  * Lightning				- Rays of lightning, bad vs shield, high damage, low range, high cost
  * Gatlinggun				- Regular boring bullets
  * Antimatter Torpedoes**- No homing, extreme high damage, big explosion (destroy planets?)
  * Black Hole Generator	- Go figure** Not implemented yet




# SHIP MODULES #

These are special modules your ship might have. These are either passive (do not need activation)
or are activated through pressing both primary and secondary fire at the same time.

MODULE				EFFECT
  * nterceptor			- Launches mini AI controlled ship that fires minishots (costs Life)
  * ECM Jammer			- Disables enemy incoming missiles. Also disables enemy cloaking.
  * Warp Engine 			- Sudden boost in speed, costs energy
  * Side Thrusters			- Allows strafing
  * Internal Nullifier		- Extreme fast turning rate
  * Shield Booster**- Faster Shield Regeneration
  * Dynamo Reactor**			- Can use shield as energy
  * Gravity Stabiliser**- Immune to Gravity and no damage from hitting planets
  * Augumented Engines**		- Faster movement
  * Automatic Repair System**- Regenerate Life
  * Interphased Drive**		- Faster Acceleration
**Not implemented yet**

RADAR					EFFECT
  * level 0 				- nothing
  * level 1 				- Show direction of all spaceships
  * level 2 				- show distance and incoming missiles, opponent shield, red arrows for enemies
  * level 3 				- show opponent energy and life, extra aim helper





# GAME CONTROLS #

  * Mouse button 1 - Fire main weapon
  * Mouse button 2 - fire secondary
  * Both	   - Use special (if any, such as jammer or interphased drive)
